- [0.8 Keywords documentation](https://robotframework-requests.netlify.app/doc/requestslibrary)

### What's new in 0.8

**New keywords structure:**
All requests keywords have been rewritten because of many not backward compatible changes
and to allow in the near future requests keywords without a session.
Example `Get Request` become `GET On Session` and soon there will be also just `GET` 
when a session is not needed.

**Implicit assert on status code:**
`* On Session` keywords automatically fail if an error status code is returned.
`expect_status=` could be used to specify a status code (`201`, `OK`, `Bad request`) or `any` if you want to evaluate the response in any case. 

**Closer to the original Requests library:**
New keywords have the same parameter orders and structure as the original.
Lot of pre-parsing / encoding has been removed to have a more accurate and unchanged behaviour.

**Cleaner project architecture:**
Main keywords file has been split with a more logic division to allow better and faster maintenance.

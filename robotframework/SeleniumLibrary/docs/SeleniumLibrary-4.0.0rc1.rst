Most important enhancements
===========================

SeleniumLibrary by creating plugin API.  (`#1292`_, alpha 1)
------------------------------------------------------------
SeleniumLibrary 4.0 introduces a plugin API, which allows adding
or modifying keywords directly in to the SeleniumLibrary. It also
offers more wider access to the SeleniumLibrary internal methods.

More details can be found from the `plugin API`_ documentation.


Selenium EventFiringWebdriver (`#1303`_, alpha 1)
-------------------------------------------------
SeleniumLibrary offers support for `Selenium EventFiringWebdriver`_ allowing
users to import the EventFiringWebdriver class in to the SeleniumLibrary.
More details can be found from the Selenium and SeleniumLibrary
`EventFiringWebdriver documentation`_

Open Browser keyword could take in Selenium browser specific options (`#1331`_, alpha 2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Open Browser` keyword provides now native way to define browser specific Selenium options.
This enhancement brings `Open Browser` keyword closer to what `Create WebDriver` keyword can do,
but with cleaner API and by using single argument. Refer to the Selenium documentation
which browser support Selenium options.

Enhance Open Browser keywords to support Selenium service_log_path argument (`#1333`_, alpha 2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the past browser driver where not logged, expect for Firefox, to a file. Now the it is possible
to define file where browser driver logs are created. This enhancement and the `#1331`_ aims
to replace `Create WebDriver` keyword.


Plugins should be last thing loaded in the SeleniumLibrary __init__ (`#1424`_, beta 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The order when plugins and event firing WebDriver are discovered when SeleniumLibrary is changed.
Now the discover of the plugin is done last and plugin has a possibility to load the event
firing WebDriver inside of the plugin.

Add better support for plugin to add event firing WebDriver (`#1425`_, beta 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A convince attribute is added for plugins, to easier add the event firing WebDriver
in the library. Now it is possible to do this:

::
    class MyPlugin(LibraryComponent):

        def __init__(self, ctx):
            LibraryComponent.__init__(self, ctx)
            self.event_firing_webdriver  = WhatEverYouWant

Change Open Browser keyword to register driver before selenium `get`is called (`#1426`_, beta 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Open Browser keyword did not register driver, before keyword called Selenium get API. This
caused that event firing WebDriver was called before the driver was registered in the
SeleniumLibrary cache. In some cases it caused problems to build proper support for plugins.
This is now fixed and driver is registed before event firing WebDriver API is triggered.

Add better documentation support for plugins (`#1430`_, rc 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------
To ease plugin documentation creation, now intro documentation, form plugin class, is added
to the end of the SeleniumLibrary keywords documentation. This eases plugin documentation.

Event firing webdriver does not work with all Selenium action chains (`#1435`_, rc 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of a bug in Selenium 3, Event firing WebDriver does not work with all Selenium
 action chains. This is already fixed in Selenium 4, but as a workaround, use normal
 WebElement for Selenium Actions chains as a backup method.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

When Selenium Grid is used the Input Text and Input Password keywords should not do file upload if input string poinst to a file  (`#1404`_, beta 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the previous releases it was possible to also use Input text or Input Password keywords to upload file,
when using Selenium Grid. But is the string accidentally points to a file, when using Selenium grid,
it will lead to hard to solve issues, because Selenium will transfer the file to the grid node and
perform the file upload. This is now solved allowing Selenium to perform file upload, when using
grid, only when using Choose File keyword.

It should be possible to configure Open Browser keyword to not always open a new browser. (`#1319`_, alpha 2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the past `Open Browser` keyword did always open a new browser. With this enhancement
new browser only opened if aliases are different for each `Open Browser` keyword.

`Choose File` keyword should not fail if file does not exist.  (`#1402`_, alpha 2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the past `Choose File` keyword only accepted strings which point to a file in the
file system. Now this is changed and SeleniumLibrary does not anymore perform checks
does the file exist, instead it is leaved for the underlying Selenium to device is the
input string a file, folder or something which is not acceptable.

Remove deprecated attributes of unofficial public API (`#1346`_, alpha 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Selenium2Library 1.8 and older did not have public API, but
it did have some methods which could be considered as part of a unofficial
API. The SeleniumLibrary 3.0 created new public API and in the same time
tried to keep as much as possible of the unofficial API in place. In
same time with 3.0 release the old API was deprecated. The SeleniumLibrary
4.0 removes the unofficial and deprecated API.

Drop Robot Framework 2.9 support in SeleniumLibrary. (`#1304`_, alpha 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SeleniumLibrary does not anymore support Robot Framework 2.9 or older
releases. Users are encouraged to migrate Robot Framework 3.0 or 3.1.

Raise minimum supported Selenium version to 3.8.1 (`#1305`_, alpha 1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimum supported Selenium version has been raised to 3.8.1.

Remove keywords which where officially deprecated in previos releases. (`#1274`_, alpha 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SeleniumLibrary has removed keyword which where loudly deprecated in the previous releases.
User are encouraged to use the new keywords.

Update SeleniumLibrary is_truthy and is_falsy to follow Robot Framework 3.1  (`#1308`_, alpha 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In previous SeleniumLibrary releases, string 0 was considered as true when evaluating
boolean type. This is now changed and string 0 is considered as false.

Deprecated features
===================

Deprecate loudly all silently deprecated keywords  (`#1273`_, alpha 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All keywords which where silently deprecated in the previous release, will now
cause a deprecated warning.

Acknowledgements

I would like to remind that providing code or updating documentation is
not the only way to contribute. There has been lot of issues raised in
the project issue tracker and feedback has been provided in the
user group and in slack. I am grateful from all the feedback.

Enhance window related keywords to work with multiple browsers (`#1427`_, beta 1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In previous releases, the different window keywords did work only with the context
of a single browser/WebDriver. Now it is possible to change WebDriver with the window
keywords and locate the desired window. Many thanks Snooz82 for making the
enhancement.

Wait For Location To Contain  (`#1108`_, alpha 1)
-------------------------------------------------
Many thanks to acaovilla who provided Wait Until Location Contains keyword in the
RoboCon sprints.
